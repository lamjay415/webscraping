The total count of the names I could fetch from the website is 92058 after removing duplicates.
Due to the fact that the program is incapable of counting names in captions
like "John Smith and Joe Brown with Bob Ross" and I did not get every title, 
the number is low considering that the pickle file had about 145000 lines 
and most captions had more than one person in it.
